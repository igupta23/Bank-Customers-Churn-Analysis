# CustomerChurnProject

Customer churn analysis is important for identifying old customers without loss and developing new products and making new strategic decisions for retaining customers. Identifying customer churn in banks will help the management to classify customers who are likely to churn early and target customers using promotions, as well as provide insight into which factors should be considered when retaining customers. This paper performs bank customer churn analysis with a predictive random forest model that predicts which customers are likely to churn. The variables: 'total transaction amount in the last 12 months', 'total transaction count in the last 12 months', 'change in transaction amount from Q4 to Q1' and 'total revolving balance' are found to be the most important variables in predicting whether a customer will churn or not.
